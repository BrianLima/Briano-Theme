# Briano Theme

### A dark theme with dark colors aimming to cause less strain ou your eyes.

Hi, if you are like me, you probably like dark themes for your IDE, my theme
tries to bring a good looking dark theme using darker colors, trying to decrease
the strain that dark-themes cause when using bright tones. It is using a cold
color scheme and has been tested for Ruby and HTML/CSS development mostly.

If you face any bugs or any design atrocities while using this, tell me, i`ll be
glad to fix it for you.

This looks better than most dark themes specially on screens with color bleeding
like low resolution LCD panels (MacBook Air, Cheapo Notebooks etc).
